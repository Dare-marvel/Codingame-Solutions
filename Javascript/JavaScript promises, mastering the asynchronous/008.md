## Question:
```
Let's do some practice with a simple exercice. You must modify the code below based on the following rules:

* The function job must return a promise object (you are in a NodeJS environment, you can use new Promise)
* The promise must resolve itself 2 seconds after the call to job and must provide hello world in the data

```
## Explanation:
This code defines a function `job` that returns a new Promise. The Promise, when resolved, will pass the string `'hello world'` as its value after a delay of 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds). The function `job` is also exported as a module.

Here's a detailed explanation of the code:
1. The `job` function is defined and takes no arguments.
2. The `job` function returns a new Promise object, created by calling the `Promise` constructor with a function argument.
3. The function passed to the `Promise` constructor takes two arguments: `resolve` and `reject`, which are functions used to resolve or reject the Promise, respectively.
4. Inside the function passed to the `Promise` constructor, the `setTimeout` function is called with three arguments: `resolve`, `2000`, and `'hello world'`.
5. The `setTimeout` function will call the `resolve` function after a delay of 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds), passing `'hello world'` as its argument.
6. When the `resolve` function is called, it will resolve the Promise returned by the `job` function with the value `'hello world'`.
7. The `job` function is exported as a module using the `module.exports` syntax.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is O(1) because all operations inside the `job` function take constant time.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity is also O(1) because only a constant amount of additional memory is used (for the Promise object).

## Code:
```js
function job() {
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(resolve, 2000, 'hello world');
});
}

module.exports = job;
```
