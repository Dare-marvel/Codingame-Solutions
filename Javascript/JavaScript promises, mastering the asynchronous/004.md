## Explanation:
This code defines a function `job` that takes two callback functions as arguments: `callback1` and `callback2`. The function schedules `callback1` to be called after a delay of 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds) using the `setTimeout` function. It also schedules `callback2` to be called repeatedly every 1000 milliseconds (1 second) using the `setInterval` function, until it has been called 3 times, after which the interval is cleared using the `clearInterval` function. The function `job` is also exported as a module.

Here's a detailed explanation of the code:
1. The `job` function is defined and takes two arguments: `callback1` and `callback2`, which are expected to be functions.
2. The `job` function calls the `setTimeout` function with two arguments: an anonymous function that calls `callback1`, and a delay of 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds).
3. The `job` function declares a variable `counter` and initializes it to 0. This variable is used to keep track of
4. how many times `callback2` has been called.
5. The `job` function calls the `setInterval` function with two arguments: an anonymous function, and a delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second).
6. The anonymous function passed to the `setInterval` function calls `callback2`, increments the value of `counter` by 1, and checks if the value of `counter` is equal to 3.
7. If the value of `counter` is equal to 3, the anonymous function calls the `clearInterval` function with the ID returned by the `setInterval` function as its argument, which clears the interval and stops calling `callback2`.
8. The ID returned by the `setInterval` function is stored in a constant variable named `id`.
9. The `job` function is exported as a module using the `module.exports` syntax.

 
## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is O(1) because all operations inside the `job` function take constant time.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity is also O(1) because only a constant amount of additional memory is used (for the variables and functions).

## Code:
```js
// Define a function named `job` that takes two arguments: `callback1` and `callback2`
function job(callback1, callback2) {
    // Call the `setTimeout` function with two arguments:
    // 1. An anonymous function that calls `callback1`
    // 2. The delay in milliseconds (2000)
    setTimeout(() => callback1(),2000);

    // Declare a variable `counter` and initialize it to 0
    let counter = 0;
    // Call the `setInterval` function with two arguments:
    // 1. An anonymous function that calls `callback2`, increments `counter`, and clears the interval if `counter` is equal to 3
    // 2. The delay in milliseconds (1000)
    const id = setInterval(() => {
        callback2();
        counter += 1

        // If `counter` is equal to 3
        if(counter === 3){
            // Clear the interval using the `clearInterval` function and the ID returned by the `setInterval` function
            clearInterval(id);
        }
    },1000);
}

// Export the `job` function as a module
module.exports = job;

```
